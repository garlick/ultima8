* Ultima base status: working with some caveats
  - The 1A fuse was replaced with a 2A fuse to address blown fuse
    when either RA or DEC motors were manipulated with the handbox.
    The higher than expected current drain has not yet been explained.
  - Noisy Celestron motodec can reset PIC in base (need better filtering
    or power supply isolation?)

* Wifi Hotspot: working with 10K tick JMI encoders and Sky Safari for
  iPad/iPhone.  Configure SkySafari for "simple encoder" or "NGC Max",
  then select "get encoder resolution automatically".  The Wifi Hotspot
  is emulating a Tangent-protocol serial encoder box attached to a
  serial-to-network adapter listening on port 4030.
