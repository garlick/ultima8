#summary scope traces for AC synchronous motor drive (old v1)

These traces were taken with the v1 design and ALCOR firmware.

== AC Motor Signal ==

It's a bit of a stretch to call this an approximation of a sine wave
with the inductive effects and whatnot, but it seems to get the job
done and it matches the waveform shown in Covington's paper,
so we declare victory.

== PIC digital outputs and FET outputs ==

In the following trace, D,,0,, = SQWAVE, D,,1,, = PHASE2, D,,2,, = PHASE1.

The analog traces are outputs of the IRL 530's before the transformer,
while driving the motor (referenced to ground).
