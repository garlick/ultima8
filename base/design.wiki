#summary Celestron Ultima 8 Drive Corrector Design (old v1)

The [http://www.telescopebluebook.com/sct/celestron.htm Celestron Ultima 8]
is an 8-inch SCT telescope with single-axis drive.  In the non-PEC variant of the Ultima, the base contains an
inverter circuit used to convert 12VDC to 120VAC used by the AC synchronous
motor that clocks the telescope in right ascension.  A plug-in hand paddle is
used to alter the frequency of the 120VAC supply to correct the motor speed
during astrophotography.  Provision is also made to drive an optional/aftermarket DC
gearhead motor for adjustments in declination.

The drive electronics in the base appear to be prone to failure.
An alternative to repairing the original electronics is to remove the lead
acid battery and the old drive electronics and replace them with a new
and hopefully more reliable drive corrector circuit.

The new drive corrector is based upon a design presented in this paper:
[http://www.ai.uga.edu/mc/alcor/alcor.pdf Alcor - A Microcontroller-Based Control Circuit for Conventional AC Telescope Drives]
by Michael A. Covington, which describes a variable frequency, two
phase drive circuit for AC syncronous motors used in telescope clock drives.
The initial design described here is Covington's hardware design pretty much
verbatim, built into the Ultima base.

== PIC Microprocessor ==

The [http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/35007b.pdf PIC 16F84A]
microprocessor is the heart of the design.  I initially went with the
same chip used in Alcor in order to avoid modifying the
[http://www.ai.uga.edu/mc/alcor/index.html Alcor firmware] as the hardware
was debugged.  The chip could be updated to a more modern, less expensive PIC
alternative.

== Transformer ==

The drive corrector employs a common 120V primary, 12VCT secondary power
transformer connected in reverse to convert the two-phase, low voltage
signal produced by
Vishay [http://www.vishay.com/docs/91299/91299.pdf IRL 530] logic level input
FET's to a high voltage signal that approximates a sine wave.

Based on measuring less than 20 mA when driving the RA motor direct from 120VAC
mains (about 2W), I initially chose a 6.0 VA transformer, the
[http://www.netsuite.com/core/media/media.nl?id=2256&c=ACCT126831&h=993caf6ef1288106eda6&_xt=.pdf Triad FS12-500],
which proved to have insufficient power to drive the motor.
I replaced it with a scavenged 12.0 VA model that worked.
I am still not sure why.  [Postscript: I got the original transformer
working in the v2 design after adding a 1N4004 diode between the 12V and 5V
supply, so the power rating was likely not the issue.]

== Power Jack ==

12VDC power is supplied to the base via a 2.1 mm I.D., 5.5 mm O.D.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_DC_Power_Connectors coaxial power connector], the type of jack used in the original drive electronics, and by many
other telescopes.

The inner conductor is the positive.  Most panel-mount jacks will allow the
negative outer conductor to become electrically connected to the metal base
housing.  This is OK provided the DEC jack is insulated from the panel housing.
A series diode protects the circuit from accidental polarity reversal.

The 
[http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/LM/LM7805.pdf LM7805] voltage regulator
converts 12VDC power to 5VDC required by the circuit.  This 1A regulator
is overkill for the design shown here, but given the amount of circuit board
real estate left over, I thought it wise to build in some headroom for
expansion.

== DEC Motor ==

Apparently Celestron resold the
[http://www.jimsmobile.com/buy_motodec.htm JMI Motodec]
with a Celstron label for this telescope.
This 12VDC gearhead motor attached to the base via a 3.5 mm
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector TRS jack] with a right-angle
adapter.  Since the polarity of the DEC motor is reversed depending on the
direction of adjustment, the jack should be completely insulated from the
metal base housing which as described above is electrically connected to the
outer (negative) pole of the 12VDC power jack.

The Texas Instruments
[http://www.ti.com/litv/pdf/slrs007b SN754410 quad half H-bridge rectifier]
converts the PIC logic level outputs to 12VDC for the motor.

== Handbox/Autoguiding Jack ==

The base is provisioned with a 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_jack RJ-25 jack]
wired as an
[http://forum.shoestringastronomy.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=288 SBIG ST-4 autoguiding port].

It should be possible to plug in the original handbox, which based on
discussions
[http://forum.shoestringastronomy.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=124 here] and
[http://forum.shoestringastronomy.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=347 here]
has the following pinout:

|| *RJ-25 pin* || *wire color*   || *description* ||
|| 1           || wht            || focus common  ||
|| 2           || blk            || ra/dec common ||
|| 3           || red            || focus-/ra- (west) ||

|| 6           || blu            || ra+ (east) ||

(with one caveat: RA+ and RA- are flipped from the ST-4 pinout).

LED's were added to give some visual feedback when autoguide corrections occur.
